C$50 Finance, a web app via which you can manage portfolios of stocks. Not only will this tool allow you to check real stocks’ actual prices and portfolios’ values, it will also let you buy (okay, “buy”) and sell (okay, “sell”) stocks by querying IEX for stocks’ prices. This was done using the IEX API. It aslo uses SQL and databases to save user loggins as well as save the history of stock trades.
